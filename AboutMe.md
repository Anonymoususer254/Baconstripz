# About me

Hello {{reader}}! Welcome to my about me file thingy! 

![1000017658](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bcb4f58-d17c-4167-b23f-17ae624210e4)

I'm Melon, also known on other platforms as Anon254, or Anonymous_user254. 

I love computer science, mainly coding/programming. I'm still learning a lot, but I'm always willing to try and help someone!  

I know a good amount of luau, and a little of gdscript. I want to learn c#, python, and many other languages!
